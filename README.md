## Installing
CAUTION, this commands apply to both backend and frontend
after cloning the repository you must run the npm install command!
###`npm install`
on both, backend and frontend directories.

then, run npm start on the frontend.
### `npm start`


##Setting the database:
First go to backend/src/database and configure your knex file, putting you MySQl data filling the gaps: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67656683/124189425-0e506a00-da97-11eb-8842-bd274c760a7f.png)

then run the dump file on src/database!
(Sorry had no time to implement seeds or migrations, kinda got obssessed/stuck with the redux).

then, npm star on the backend!

This CRUD, was developed in 48hrs, has only a few validations on the backend but the frontend is alright.
I used mainly, REACT, NODE.JS and had the brilliant(stupid) idea of trying to use antd for the first time!
also, Redux, redux-api-middleware, redux-thunk, date-fns, antd-maskedinput, lodash and that's about it! Any questions, please sende me a message on my linkedin or E-mail
